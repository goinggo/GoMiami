/*
Select is control structure that is unqiue to concurrency.

The reason channels and Goroutines are built into the language.

Like a switch but each case is a communication:
-- All channels are evaluated
-- Selection blocks until one communication can proceed, which then does.
-- If multiple can proceed, select choose pseudo-randomly.
-- Default clause, if present, executes immediately if no channel is ready.

Multiplexing: Let whosoever is ready to talk, talk.

The fanIn function fronts the other channels. Goroutines that are ready to talk
can independently talk without Blocking the other Goroutines. The FanIn channel
receives all messages for processing.

Decouples the execution between the different Goroutines.

Joe ---
       \
        ----- FanIn --- Independent Messages Displayed
       /
Ann ---
